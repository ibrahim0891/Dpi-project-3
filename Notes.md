# Notes from employe (ibrahim)

## Important note
For your design range I will place some *flag comment* in the component so that you can understand the safe zone for safe modification so that you don't break anything. 

#### These flags are: 
- Experimental 
- Under development
- Ready 
- Logics

### Experimental
> Experimental pages are almost ready pages .
These pages goes under various tests. Once these pages are ready you can decorate it.

### Under Development
> This pages will be highly modified. New elements will be added or removed. new logics will be implemented on these pages

### Ready
> This pages are full tested and you are free to decorate and modify the page components

### Logics
> File marked with this flags are solely responsible for handleling functional logic that makes the frontend communicate with backend and also manage the intection between other components. 
Please DO NOT modify anything of these pages unless you know what you doing. 

## Notice
**If you accidently break anything please contact me before commiting changes to github**
